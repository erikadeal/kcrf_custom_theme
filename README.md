# King County Refugee Forum Custom Theme

This is the custom theme for the King County Refugee Forum website. It's 
built on the Bones development framework and works with the KCRF Toolkit
plugin to extend functionality. SCSS stylesheets keep styles clean and organized.

The theme includes:
--Custom templates for a member directory, member profiles, and a member services page
--Archive template for organization meetings
--Static front page with widget areas and a customizable banner image/image credit/caption
--Three sidebars and a widgetized footer
--Simplified and customized admin interface for both administrators and members

This theme requires the KCRF Toolkit plugin to be fully functional.
